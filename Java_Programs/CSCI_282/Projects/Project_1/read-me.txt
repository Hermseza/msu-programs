Warnings/errors

When the third input digit is a 3, the first number to be displayed in "Encoded Integer: " (which is supposed
to be a 0) is not displayed.

When all of the inputs are 3, the Encoded Integer is 0.

The "Decoded Integer" does not display leading 0's, ex: 0011 is only displayed as 11.
